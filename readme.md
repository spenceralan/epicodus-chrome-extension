# Epicodus Chrome Extension

This project will save the world! Or it might help you remember to sign in when you start your day at Epicodus. Or both!

If you have ever forgotten the url to the Epicodus sign in and out page, can for the life of you remember the url to Epicenter, or never knew and don't know where to find the link to the Epicodus queue... this app is for you!

Not only do we provide the paths to get to those critical places, we give you a form to fill out that will sign you in too! There are so many reasons to install this extension!

### Prerequisites

* Chrome

### Installing

There are two ways to install this app on your machine! The first is the easiest, it is hosted in the Chrome Extension Store for free!

NOTE: The store will always feature the lastest stable version. This app is still in development. For new and experimental features you can clone the app here and install it to Chrome manually.

#### Manual Installation

Luckily for you, Chrome makes adding an extension really easy! First you will want to clone this repository to your machine. Then, in Chrome, you will navigate to your settings and find the extensions tab.

Once you are in the extensions tab, you must enable "Developer mode."

After that, its as simple as clicking "Load unpacked extension..." and selecting the folder you just cloned!
